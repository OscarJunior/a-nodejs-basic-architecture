# NODEJS BASIC ARCHITECTURE
The aid of this project is to show some of the *NODE.JS* best practices, to do it we are gonna put them in code, each one comes [from this repository](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#1-project-structure-practices).
The illustration of them is far away from the project scope, it is this repository that contains the extended explication of them.

Well, our contribution will be to create a new setup that allows adding, removing, testing, debugging each practice.

For this, we gonna use these technologies:

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* MongoDB
* Express
* NPM
* eslint
* prettier
* vscode
* nodemon
* rc

The most of them are explained [in this repository](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#1-project-structure-practices), too.
We are gonna use *Docker* as cornerstone so it and *Docker Compose* will only be the two technologies we need to install in our local environment (I mean, in our machine).

Running the app:

1. Create a new file whose name is *.envrc*. To keep itâ€™s simple, this file could be a copy from *.envrc.sample*
2. Execute `./script/up.sh`
3. Enjoy it
